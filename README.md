This project solves the problem of calculating the details of installments of multiple contracts 

- contracts table have information about each contract : start date , end date , total amount of money , payment type (annually , monthly , quarter ,..)

- so I created PL-SQL script that checks on contracts table and create table called installments that have every installment with its required date and money amount
